Polymorphism (Virtual Functions)

Polymorphism is the ability to substitute objects of matching interfaces for one another at run-time. C++
implements polymorphism with virtual functions. In C, you can also implement virtual functions in a
number of ways [1,4,10]. The implementation presented here (and used in the QP/C and QP-nano real-time
frameworks) has very similar performance and memory overhead as virtual functions in C++
