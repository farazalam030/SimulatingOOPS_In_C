# SimulatingOOPS_In_C
To see how to implement basic OOPS Design pattern in C language


Introduction
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is not the use of a particular language or a tool. It is rather a way of
design based on the three fundamental concepts:
• Encapsulation – the ability to package data and functions together into classes
• Inheritance – the ability to define new classes based on existing classes in order to obtain reuse and
code organization
• Polymorphism – the ability to substitute objects of matching interfaces for one another at run-time
